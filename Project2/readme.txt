The Program was developed on Visual Studio 2015 that was configured during class.
Visual Studio 2015 was ran on Parallels on a 2016 MacBook Pro.

There are no special step to run the program. 

The program has no particular known bugs besides having some issues when updating the 
records when deleting teams.

I approached this program like the last one. I created sql functions based on commands
I used C++ to do math computation rather than SQL as a result I read the table and 
manipulated the data read in and created queries to update the database.
